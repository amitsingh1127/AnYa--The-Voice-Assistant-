One of the main advantages of voice searches is their rapidity. In fact, voice is reputed to be four times faster than a written search: whereas we can write about 40 words per minute, we can speak around 150 during the same period of time. In this respect, the ability of personal assistants to accurately recognize spoken words is a prerequisite for them to be adopted by consumers.
